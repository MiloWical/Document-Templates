# {Pattern Name} (_Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture_ Pattern Template)

## Also Known As

{Other names for the pattern, if any are known.}

## Example

{A real-world example demonstrating the existence of the problem and the need for the pattern.}

## Context

{The situations in which the pattern may apply.}

## Problem

{The problem the pattern addresses, including a discussion of the associated forces.}

## Solution

{The fundamental solution principle underlying the pattern.}

## Structure

{A detailed specification of the structural aspects of the pattern, potentially including an Object Modeling Technique/Unified Modeling Language class diagram.}

## Dynamics

{Typical scenarios describing the run-time behavior of the pattern. These can be illustrated with diagrams such as Object Message Sequence Charts or UML Sequence Diagrams.}

## Implementation

{Guidelines for implementing the pattern. These are only a suggestion, not an immutable rule. You should adapt the implementation to meet your needs by adding different, extra, or more detailed steps, or by re-ordering the steps.}

## Example Resolved

{Discussion of any important aspects for resolving the example that are not yet covered in the Solution, Structure, Dynamics, and Implementation sections.}

## Variants

{A brief description of variants or specializations of a pattern.}

## Known Uses

{Examples of the use of the pattern, taken from existing systems.}

## Consequences

{The benefits that the pattern provides, and any potential liabilities.}

## See Also

{References to patterns that solve similar problems, and to patterns that help us refine the pattern we are describing.}

## Credits

{A note to mention who identified and recorded the pattern, or the source of the pattern if it came from an external party.}
