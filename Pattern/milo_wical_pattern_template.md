# {Pattern Name} (Milo Wical's Pattern Template)

## Icon

{A graphic that can be used to represent this pattern in more complex solutions, regardless of how the pattern is implemented. It is particularly useful in the Solution Views section to help keep some of the views from being overly cluttered with detail.}

## Context

{This section sets up the operating conditions of a system exhibiting a type of problem that needs to be solved. The obstacle to be overcome should be described in a manner that naturally leads the reader to the solution.}

## Solution Summary

{A brief (no more than 3-5 sentences) description of the solution and how it addresses the obstacles mentioned.}

## Forces

{A summary of the influences that led to the discovery and/or application of this pattern. If there is more than 1 classification of forces, this description can be omitted in preference for the classified force description. The list of forces below is not intended to be exhaustive, nor do all patterns include/resolve all the force types mentioned.}

### Technological Forces

{What were the technological rationales for defining this pattern? Did they have to do with initial implementation? Modernization of legacy systems? Decoupling/recoupling into smaller/larger components? New technology that enables a different type of solution?}

### Business Forces

{What drivers from the business forced this pattern to emerge? Were there quality attribute (efficiency, scalability, deployability, testability, etc.) concerns? Was there a new or refactored business capability that this enables? Does the pattern have an impact on development, hosting, or support costs?}

### Market Forces

{What pressures does the market apply that the pattern addresses? Are there customer experience desires that are fulfilled or frustration pain points that are remedied? Is the pattern affected by industry regulations that need to be satisfied for legal or compliance reasons? Are there changes in affiliate company behaviors that are accommodated with this pattern made manifest?}

## Solution Detail

{A more detailed description of how the solution satisfies the forces or mitigates liabilities that the forces influence. This description can also include pseudocode algorithms, verbal descriptions of process flows, explanations of actors’ involvement in the pattern, etc.}

## Solution Views

{Many times, a pattern becomes more self-evident when accompanied by one or more diagrams. The diagrams should be detailed enough to capture the crux of the pattern and require very little supporting prose to explain its context relative to the problem the pattern is attempting to solve. The views should be created from a specific viewpoint, i.e., a certain perspective that the reader has when interpreting a view. When there exists more than 1 applicable viewpoint, the views should be organized based on viewpoint. The viewpoints below are suggestions; they are neither an exhaustive list nor represent required viewpoints.}

### Business Process View

{Diagrams that represent one or more business processes that result from applying this pattern. These views may or may not have a technology component, depending on the type of pattern. These can be draw with informal techniques, as well as formal diagramming systems like the Business Process Model and Notation.}

### Interaction View

{Diagrams that illustrate the interactions of systems that are actors within the pattern. These diagrams can include both formal diagram structures such as the Unified Modeling Language sequence diagrams, as well as informal depictions.}

### Data View

{Diagrams that include both the flow of data through a system, as well as structural diagrams of how the data is modeled (e.g., Entity Relationship Diagrams). Additionally, these views can contain representations of data structures that might be used to implement algorithms described in the Solution Detail section.}

### Infrastructure View

{Diagrams that relate to how the systems that comprise the pattern are physically laid out. Some of the detail necessary in this view might include network types, addressing schemes, protocols, and security mechanisms. This view can include generic as well as platform-specific symbol sets (e.g., Azure, AWS). It also reflects the type of runtimes the systems use, such as IaaS resources or containerized platforms. Additionally, supplemental systems required to support the pattern need to be denoted, such as package repositories or third-party data sources.}

### Component View

{Diagrams that specify the services or code-level components necessary to realize the pattern. These diagrams should only include information relevant to the implementation of the pattern; authors should avoid using references to specific packages unless that detail is important (e.g., a system library necessary regardless the implementation). These diagrams can be informal “box-and-line” sketches or can be more formal, such as the Unified Modeling Language class, component, or sequence diagrams.}

## Relevant Components

{This section describes the code-level resources (class names and relationships, namespaces, packages, library dependencies, etc.) that constitute important units of functionality in the pattern. The relationships between them should be described in enough detail that the reader could implement the components. These components can also map to services that interact within the pattern. The components should not be described in way that ties the solution to a specific language/technology unless absolutely necessary (e.g., mobile apps or embedded systems). Diagrams that illustrate the component configuration can be included here if the Component View section above is not provided.}

## Reference Implementations

{A list of implementations found “in the wild” that illustrate the spirit of the pattern. Each implementation can also be described with a brief description (1-2 sentences) that explains the context of the implementation.}

## Implications

{This section outlines the benefits of implementing this pattern, as well as any additional consequences to be aware of. Interactions between patterns that might be relevant should also be mentioned in the event multiple patterns are used to solve a more complex problem.}

## Related Patterns

{A bulleted list of patterns that serve as alternatives or compliments to the current pattern.}

## Further Reading

{A bulleted list of references to information that clarifies the pattern context or supplements the information in the solution detail.}

## Credits

{A note to mention who identified and recorded the pattern, or the source of the pattern if it came from an external party.}
