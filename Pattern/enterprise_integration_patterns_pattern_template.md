# {Pattern Name} (_Enterprise Integration Patterns_ Pattern Template)

## Icon

{Most patterns are associated with an icon in addition to the pattern name. Because many architects are used to communicating visually through diagrams, we provide a visual language in addition to the verbal language. The visual language underlines the composability of patterns, as multiple pattern icons can be combined to describe the solution of a larger, more complex pattern.}

## Context

{This section explains what type of work might make you run into the problem that this pattern solves. The context sets the stage for the problem and often refers to other patterns that you may have already applied.}

## Problem

{This explains the difficulty you are facing, expressed as either a question or a statement. You should be able to read the problem statement and quickly determine if this pattern is relevant to your work.}

## Forces

{The forces explore the constraints that make the problem difficult to solve. They often consider alternative solutions that seem promising but don’t pan out, which helps show the value of the real solution.}

## Solution

{This part explains what you should do to solve the problem. It is not limited to your particular situation, but describes what to do in the variety of circumstances represented by the problem. If you understand a pattern’s problem and solution, you understand the pattern.}

## Sketch

{One of the most appealing properties of the Alexandrian form (which this template is based on) is that each pattern contains a sketch that illustrates the solution. In many cases, just by looking at the pattern name and the sketch, you can understand the essence of the pattern.}

## Results

{This part expands upon the solution to explain the details of how to apply the solution and how it resolves the forces. It also addresses new challenges that may arise as a result of applying the pattern.}

## Next

{This section lists other patterns to be considered after applying the current one. Patterns don’t live in isolation; the application of one pattern usually leads you to new problems that are solves by other patterns. The relationships between patterns are what constitutes a pattern language as opposed to just a pattern catalog.}

## Sidebars

{These sections discuss more detailed technical issues or variations of the pattern.}

## Examples

{A pattern usually includes one or more examples of the pattern being applied or having been applied. An example may be as simple as naming a known use or as detailed as a large segment of sample code.}

## Credits

{A note to mention who identified and recorded the pattern, or the source of the pattern if it came from an external party.}
