# {Pattern Name} (Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture Pattern Template)

## Description

### Intent

{A sentence or two that sums up the pattern.}

### Sketch

{A visual representation of the pattern, often but not always a Unified Modeling Language diagram.}

## How It Works

{A description of the solution, including a discussion of implementation issues and variations the author’s come across. The discussion is as independent as possible of any particular platform. Unified Modeling Language diagrams can also be included to help explain the solution.}

## When to Use It

{Describes when the pattern should be used. This includes a discussion of the trade-offs that make you select this solution compared to others. Few patterns are always the right choice so when evaluating a pattern, it’s also valuable to ask, “When would I not use this?”}

## Further Reading

{Points the reader to other discussions of this pattern.}

## Examples

### Example: {Description}

{A simple example of the pattern in use, illustrated with some code in a language the reader would be able to understand (e.g., C#, Java, TypeScript, Python). It’s absolutely essential to understand that the example is not the pattern. When you use the pattern, it won’t look exactly like the example so don’t treat it as some kind of glorified macro. All sorts of issues are ignored that will become important when you use the pattern, but these will be particular to your own environment. This is why you always have to tweak the pattern.}

## Credits

{A note to mention who identified and recorded the pattern, or the source of the pattern if it came from an external party.}

_Note – this is based on the pattern definition presented in M. Fowler, <u>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture.</u> Boston: Addison-Wesley, 2015._
