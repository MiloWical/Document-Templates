# {Pattern Name} (_Microsoft Azure Cloud Design Patterns_ Pattern Template)

## Summary

{A few sentences that provides the reader an overview of the motivation that inspired the creation of the pattern.}

## Context and problem

{This section begins with a discussion of the technological elements involved in the operating conditions that form the genesis of the problem. The section continues with a description (including optional diagrams) that explain a circumstance in which some critical capability of the context cannot be fully realized.}

## Solution

{A description of the solution that forms the pattern, informed by the summary and operating within the context, that provides the necessary capability. The solution is depicted in a generic manner, allowing it to be used as a starting point for creating tailored solutions.}

## Issues and considerations

{A discussion of the benefits, liabilities, and limitations of applying the pattern. This section also points out additional considerations that need to be taken into consideration which might affect the success of the application of the pattern.}

## When to use this pattern

{A brief explanation of situations in which this pattern might be considered beneficial, as well as situations in which it might appear that the pattern applies, though in reality it’s not fit for purpose.}

## Examples

{Explanations, diagrams, and/or code snippets that illustrate the application of the pattern for a specific use case. Most implementations will require a degree of customization, so these examples (1) should not be taken as copy-and-paste solutions and (2) should not be used without careful consideration of the points presented in the “Issues and considerations” section.}

## Next steps

{A bulleted list of additional resources that can be used to better understand the context, problem, and/or solution.}

## Related resources

{A bulleted list of additional patterns that are either related to this pattern or complement it.}

## Credits

{A note to mention who identified and recorded the pattern, or the source of the pattern if it came from an external party.}
