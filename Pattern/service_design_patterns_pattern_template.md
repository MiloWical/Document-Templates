# {Pattern Name} (Service Design Patterns Pattern Template)

## Context

{The context follows the pattern name and is expressed in no more than a few sentences. It identifies the general scenario in which the pattern might apply. This section may refer to other patterns that help set the context.}

## Problem

{The problem to solve is stated as a single question or comment. You should be able to read the problem and quickly determine if the pattern is relevant to the design challenge you are facing.}

## Forces

{A real-world example demonstrating the existence of the problem and the need for the pattern.}

## Solution Summary

{This section provides a brief description of the design solution, in a few sentences. Despite its terseness, you should be able to quickly understand how the problem can be solved. The solution summary typically describes the primary entities that comprise the design, their responsibilities and relationships, and the way they work together to solve the problem. The solution is not meant to be an absolute prescription that has one and only one implementation. Rather, it should be viewed as a general template that can be implemented in many different ways. The written summary is usually accompanies by a diagram to supplement the narrative. In many cases, these include Object Modeling Technique/Unified Modeling Language sequence and class diagrams. In other cases, the solution is modeled through nonstandard graphical depictions.} 

## Solution Detail

{This section presents several aspects of the solution in a prosaic style. It expands on the solution summary to explore how the primary elements of the solution are employed in order to solve the problem and resolve the forces. Since every solution has benefits and drawbacks, this section reviews the consequences and additional factors you may need to consider. Related patterns can be pointed out that exist in this and other pattern catalogs.}

## Considerations

{This section discusses additional factors you may need to consider when using the pattern. Such factors include design considerations, related technologies and a variety of other pertinent topics. Bulleted lists can be used to help the reader skim this section and hone in on specific topics of interest. This section does not need to occur in each and every pattern.} 

## Examples

{This section is meant to supplement the prior sections. You should be able to understand the essence of a pattern without having to read this section. Some patterns offer several examples to help you understand the many ways in which the pattern may be implemented. Other patterns only provide a few examples to facilitate understanding.}

## Credits

{A note to mention who identified and recorded the pattern, or the source of the pattern if it came from an external party.}
